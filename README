Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tpz-base-32 is a library for the encoding of various values into strings
and from such strings back into the original value(s), via the encoding
alphabet featured in the z-base-32 encoding but with a surely-different
coding algorithm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extensibility
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current implementation provides direct caller support for encoding and
decoding of System.Int32 values but is internally constructed such that it can
support values ranging from single bits through all sizes of .net-supported
signed and unsigned integral values and even continuous streams of values.

There are two types of encoder/decoder implementation in the library:
1. The "Reference" implementation. This takes a iterator-based approach to
   decomposing and implementing the encoding and decoding process, is most
   amenable to supporting voluminous and/or entirely streaming data, is the
   easiest to extend, and is actually of reasonably high performance all told.
   Importantly, the "Reference" implementation provides the baseline against
   which custom implementations are tested.
2. "Custom" implementations. These take a direct approach to the encoding and
   decoding process and are best suited to extremely high load usages where,
   for example, the hundreds of thousands of round trips per second supported
   by the "Reference" implementation simply is not good enough. "Custom"
   implementations are tested via a standardized suite of automated unit tests
   and exhaustively tested via comparison to an equivalent "Reference"
   implementation.

To extend tpz-base-32 to support a new input/output type, you first create
and automate testing of new "Reference" implementation input/output type
handling and then optionally create and automate testing of a new "Custom"-
style implementation.

Extending the Reference implementation to support a new input/output type
requires only two noteworthy steps:

1. Implement a new encoding method whose sole unique feature is the unpacking
   of the new input type into a sequence of bits.
2. Implement a new decoding method whose sole unique feature is the packing
   of a sequence of bits into a sequence of values of the desired output type.

All other required encoding and decoding logic is already provided in the
reference implementation and called simply from the two methods listed above.

Contributing to tpz-base-32
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should you choose to implement support for a new input/output type, project
contributions are most happily accepted! Two additional requirements for such
contributions are worth mentioning immediately:

1. All contributions must include comprehensive test automation, patterned off
   of the test automation included with the most recent version of tpz-base-32
   that is available at the time of contribution.
2. All "Custom"-style implementation contributions must also include an
   equivalent "Reference" implementation, unless one is already available for
   the contributed input/output type.

Since it must be said: contributions are subject to review, rejection,
modification, etc. for any reason and without notice.

Source code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tpz-base-32 .net implementation source code is available on GitHub at the
following location:

http://github.com/twopointzero/tpz-base-32

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Fork the twopointzero/tpz-base-32 repo on GitHub and clone your fork into
   your local development environment.
2. Init and update submodules, as the NUnit package is included via submodule.
3. Build the solution using your choice of msbuild, devenv, etc.
4. Run the unit tests using your NUnit test runner of choice.

Rationale
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why create tpz-base-32 and not just implement/use z-base-32?

The z-base-32 specification provides excellent rationale for its encoding
alphabet. The specification is, on the other hand, critically lacking in terms
of an actual algorithmic description. The available normative implementations
(in C and Python) are documented poorly and their automated test suites lack
sufficient explicit input/output verification, instead being overly focused
on round-trip comparisons that risk symmetrical behavioural errors. Further,
the official internet location for the z-base-32 specification has been
unavailable throughout the implementation of tpz-base-32, making it that much
less viable a source of specification or implementation.

tpz-base-32 leverages the wisdom inherent in the z-base-32 encoding alphabet
and normalization rules while defining its own encoding and decoding process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The encoding alphabet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tpz-base-32 uses the z-base-32 encoding alphabet, as defined by zooko et al.
The encoding alphabet captures 5 bits per character, representing the values
0 through 31 as follows:

The selected alphabet, its casing, the letters and numbers it chooses to
include/exclude, the order in which the characters exist within the alphabet,
the rules for normalizing input to account for common for transcription errors
and much more are explained in detail in the z-base-32 specification. The
specification document's hosting domain has been unavailable throughout the
implementation of tpz-base-32, but the following Wikipedia line (at time of
writing) can provide a starting point:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The encoding and decoding process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tpz-base-32 has been designed to be amenable to a wide range of data, ranging
from single bits of information through various signed and unsigned numeric
types and right on up to long (or even continuous) streams of binary
information. It achieves this through the following conceptual encoding and
decoding process (which any "Custom" implementation is free to optimize):

Encoding:
1. Convert the input value(s) bitwise representation into a sequence of bits
   ordered from least significant to most significant. Signed values whose
   bitwise representation is in two's complement are converted directly as
   such. If converting a sequence of values, the values are introduced into
   the sequence from first/least-significant to last/most-significant, with
   each value's bits sequenced from least significant to most significant,
   as mentioned previously.
2. Convert the sequence of bits into a sequence of 5-bit numbers, with each
   value constructed from least-significant bit to most-significant bit.
3. Convert the sequence of 5-bit numbers into a sequence of encoded characters.
   Each value is converted by using it is a zero-based index into the set of
   characters in the encoding alphabet.
4. Optionally trim the resulting sequence of characters of any trailing (in
   other words, _most_ significant) zero values ('y' characters). If the
   sequence consisted only of zero values ('y' characters), at least one such
   character must be returned in the final result so as to distinguish from
   the lack of any value.

Decoding:
1. Normalize the input string as per the z-base-32 specification.
2. Convert the sequence of encoded characters into a sequence of 5-bit values.
   Each value is converted by determining its zero-based index in the set of
   characters in the encoding alphabet.
3. Convert the sequence of 5-bit values into a sequence of bits, with each
   5-bit value unpacked into the bit sequence in order from least
   significant bit to most significant bit.
4. Convert the sequence of bits into the output value(s), recreating each
   value's bitwise representation by interpreting the sequence of bits as
   ordered from least significant to most significant. Signed values whose
   bitwise representation is in two's complement are converted directly as
   such. If converting a sequence of values, the values are extracted from
   the sequence from first/least-significant to last/most-significant, with
   each value's bits sequenced from least significant to most significant,
   as mentioned previously.
